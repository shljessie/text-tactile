## Key Features

- **Tile-Based Interface**: Users build visual scenes by adding, moving, editing, and arranging objects, each represented as a tile.
  
- **Generative AI Integration**: AI generates graphics based on user prompts, producing simple, thick-outlined images for easy tactile rendering and interpretation.

- **Keyboard-Controlled Accessibility**: Users can navigate tiles, adjust sizes, move items, and more, using intuitive keyboard commands. Each command triggers clear audio feedback.

- **Real-Time Audio Feedback**: Actions like moving or resizing images produce sound cues, enhancing spatial understanding of the canvas.

- **Spatial Awareness and Radar Scan**: The radar scan feature provides positional feedback for nearby objects, assisting users in comprehending layout and planning edits.

- **Tactile Graphics Support**: Rendered images can be saved with clear outlines and backgrounds, optimized for tactile graphic generation.
